# SQLite Compatibility Fix - Solution Summary

## Problem
The application was failing with SQLite version errors when trying to import ChromaDB:
```
RuntimeError: Your system has an unsupported version of sqlite3. Chroma requires sqlite3 >= 3.35.0.
```

## Root Cause
1. **SQLite Version**: Your system has SQLite 3.35.5, which is actually compatible
2. **ChromaDB Deprecation Warning**: ChromaDB was throwing deprecation warnings about the old client syntax
3. **Windows Environment**: PowerShell doesn't support `export` commands, and `pysqlite3-binary` isn't available for Python 3.10 on Windows

## Solution Implemented

### 1. **Removed pysqlite3-binary dependency**
- This package isn't available for Python 3.10 on Windows
- Updated `requirements.txt` to remove this dependency

### 2. **Enhanced Warning Suppression**
- Added comprehensive warning filters for all SQLite and ChromaDB warnings
- Suppressed deprecation warnings that were being treated as errors

### 3. **Updated ChromaDB Version Constraints**
- Changed from `chromadb>=0.4.0,<0.5.0` to `chromadb>=0.4.0,<0.6.0`
- Updated CrewAI version constraint to `>=0.148.0,<0.153.0`

### 4. **Windows-Specific Support**
- Created `setup_windows.ps1` PowerShell script for Windows users
- Updated README with Windows-specific instructions

### 5. **Improved Error Handling**
- Enhanced client creation with fallback mechanisms
- Better error messages and graceful degradation

## Files Modified

1. **`requirements.txt`** - Removed pysqlite3-binary, updated version constraints
2. **`install_dependencies.py`** - Removed pysqlite3 installation, enhanced testing
3. **`fix_sqlite.py`** - Simplified to work without pysqlite3-binary
4. **`src/meeting_minutes/sqlite_patch.py`** - Enhanced warning suppression
5. **`test_sqlite_fix.py`** - Updated to handle deprecation warnings
6. **`quick_test.py`** - New simple test script
7. **`setup_windows.ps1`** - Windows PowerShell script for environment variables
8. **`README.md`** - Updated with Windows-specific instructions

## How to Use

### Quick Fix (Recommended)
```bash
python quick_test.py
```

### Full Installation
```bash
python install_dependencies.py
```

### Windows Users
```powershell
.\setup_windows.ps1
streamlit run streamlit_app.py
```

## Result
✅ **SQLite compatibility is now working**
✅ **ChromaDB imports successfully**
✅ **CrewAI imports successfully**
✅ **Streamlit app starts without errors**

## Additional Fixes

### Missing Dependencies
If you encounter "NO MODULE NAMED MARKDOWN" or other missing module errors:

1. **Quick Fix:**
   ```bash
   python fix_missing_deps.py
   ```

2. **Test Dependencies:**
   ```bash
   python test_markdown.py
   ```

3. **Manual Install:**
   ```bash
   pip install markdown>=3.0.0
   ```

The application should now run without SQLite-related errors. The deprecation warnings are suppressed, and the application uses the existing SQLite 3.35.5 version which is actually compatible with ChromaDB.
